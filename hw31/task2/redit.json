      "body": "Then you clearly don't understand the situation of some people (most lurkers?) here. They don't need help to fuck 10 girls per month instead of 4-5. They need help to fucking go out and appear attractive. Yeah, you aren't socially awkward. I'll make a wild guess and say that you weren't a geek / nerd in high school or even if you were, you didn't only socialize with other geeks. You weren't considered a loser, you didn't only talk to other guys in your situation, maybe you lost your virginity before you turned 18 and had a couple of girlfriends. For you it might appear creepy and fake.\n\nHowever, there are people who didn't socialize as well as you did. They are geeks who have socialized mostly with other geeks who shared their interest. Now they are trying to find a way to socialize with other people too (or they could wait for a geeky girl... however, most geeks are familiar with probability theories, so they know that it's rather futile) in order to meet (and attract) girls. Yeah, some people go overboard (beautifully illustrated in Neil Strauss's \"The Game\"), but others need this kind of help rather than the usual \"Be Yourself!\", \"Be kind to girls you like!\", \"Be a gentleman!\" bullshit they get from their older female relatives.\n\nNo one is an instant expert at everything. Some people need help at math. Some need help at foreign languages. And some need help at social interactions. I'm a mathematically minded programer who sometimes teaches math and programing to less mathematically minded or less... well, programmer-capable people. And sometimes I look at their attempts to solve a hard problem and cringe because they desperately try to apply the basic methods I've taught to them to a new problem instead of trying to invent their own methods (which I would do because I can do math and programming on a higher level). Do I think they are stupid? No. I think they have the wrong mindset for this kind of exercise and I try to change their minds in order to let them write algorithms or prove theorems themselves. However, it isn't easy. I can't just tell them the correct method because they wouldn't understand the path from their methods to mine. I have to lead them through that path.\n\nIt's the same with social interactions. You can't just tell a geek with approach anxiety and no clue about how women think to just go to the hot girl at the bar and talk to her. You have to lead them through the path. The first steps will appear fake and creepy because... well, they are fake and creepy. However, these are necessary steps to take towards being a socially capable man.",
